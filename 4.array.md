# Arrays in Javascript

An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. If you have a list of items (a list of car names, for example), storing the cars in single variables could look like this:

```javascript
var car1 = "Saab";
var car2 = "Volvo";
var car3 = "BMW";
```

However, what if you want to loop through the cars and find a specific one? And what if you had not 3 cars, but 300? The solution is an array!

An array can hold many values under a single name, and you can access the values by referring to an index number.

## Creating an Array

Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JavaScript Array.

Syntax:

```javascript
var array_name = [item1, item2, ...]; // or
var array_name = [];
```

Example:

```javascript
var cars = ["Saab", "Volvo", "BMW"];
```

## Access the Elements of an Array

You access an array element by referring to the index number.

This statement accesses the value of the first element in cars:

```javascript
var name = cars[0];
```

## Changing an Array Element

Array elements are accessed using their index number:

```javascript
cars[0] = "Opel";
```

## Array methods and properties

### Array Properties

#### Length

To get the number of elements in an array, use the length property:

```javascript
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
var len = fruits.length; // the value of len is 4
```

#### Adding Array Elements

The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the push() method, push method will return the new array length.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.push("Lemon"); // adds a new element (Lemon) to fruits

// the value of fruits is ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango", "Lemon"]
```

#### Removing Array Elements

The easiest way to remove a new element to an array is using the pop() method, pop method will return the removed element.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.pop(); // removes the last element ("Mango") from fruits

// the value of fruits is ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple"]
```

#### Shifting Elements

Shifting is equivalent to popping, working on the first element instead of the last.

The shift() method removes the first array element and "shifts" all other elements to a lower index.

```javascript
var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.shift(); // removes the first element "Banana" from fruits

// the value of fruits is ["Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]
```

#### Adding Array Elements

The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the unshift() method, unshift method will return the new array length.

```javascript

var fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.unshift("Lemon"); // adds a new element "Lemon" to fruits

// the value of fruits is ["Lemon", "Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"]
```
